# My Recipes, a Single-Page Application

## About
This is a Single-Page Application that allows a user to 
add, edit, save, delete their own recipes to the cloud!
<br>
Being a food and BBQ enthusiast, coupled with my love for tech, developing a web application that allows the user to create and store their own recipes made perfect sense.  This app came about as I was trying to find a dedicated digital space to store recipes I really enjoyed making and especially for ones I was experimenting with.  I built the entire application from scratch using the tech listed below.

The live application can be found [here](https://intense-hollows-82524.herokuapp.com/).


## Built with
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (v1.6.4)
* [AngularJS Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) (v1.1.4) - The Angular Material framework is used to implement UI features.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is used to store a user's recipes.

## Deployed with
* This application is deployed to Heroku and the cloud database is managed with [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
